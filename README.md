Finding Genetic Biomarkers of Schizophrenia using neuro-spheroid generated from Adipose cell 

Schizophrenia is a common yet devastating mental disorder characterized by a series of cognitive, behavioral and emotional dysfunctions, none of which are pathognomonic for the disease.
Schizophrenia is basically thought to be a disease that occurs due to a problem in the brain, but it is difficult to actually biopsy the brain. So, we extracted adipocytes from patients, high-risk groups (family members) and normal people and differentiated them into neural stem cells in vitro with small molecules. To analyze this with high resolution, 10X genomics single cell RNA seq was performed. Using scRNA-seq, 1) differentiation process, lineage tracing, 2) gene regulation analysis (genetic module), 3) differential abundance analysis according to the presence or absence of disease, and 4) cell-cell interaction can be analyzed. Using this, it is possible to know what expression genetic factor causes schizophrenia, and at what stage or in which cell it will cause disease.
